# Muenchen Child Starter

A child theme starter kit for WordPress.

## Description
This is a starter kit for a custom child theme. Child themes in WordPress enable you to override theme templates and stylesheets with your own customizations in a safe way. No need to touch an original theme file!

This starter kit uses our own theme [Muenchen](http://marketpress.com/product/muenchen/) as the parent theme. Feel free to use it for your own projects, or hack it and create your own child theme starter kit.

Also, as in Muenchen and many other themes, minified stylesheets can be loaded by default. In order to load minified versions of stylesheets and scripts, visit `functions.php` and set a filter as documented inline.
